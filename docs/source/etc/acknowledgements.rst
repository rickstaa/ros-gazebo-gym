We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of the `The Construct team`_ in creating the
`openai_ros`_ package. It provided us with a great template to build our new framework.
Maybe in the future features found in the :ros_gazebo_gym:`ros_gazebo_gym <>` package can
be backported into the `openai_ros`_ package or even better combined into a new package
under the `ros-simulation`_ organization.
