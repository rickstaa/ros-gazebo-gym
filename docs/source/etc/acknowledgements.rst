We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of the `The Construct team`_ in creating the
:openai_ros:`openai_ros <>` package. It provided us with a great template to build our new framework.
Maybe in the future features found in the :ros-gazebo-gym:`ROS Gazebo Gym <>` framework can
be backported into the :openai_ros:`openai_ros <>` package or even better combined into a new package
under the `ros-simulation`_ organization.
