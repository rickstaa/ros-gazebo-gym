Introduction

The Panda robot, designed by `Franka Emika`_, is a sophisticated 7DOF research robot. Characterized by its sensitivity, agility,
and torque sensors at each joint, the Panda robot offers adjustable stiffness/compliance and advanced torque control. It is
controlled through the `Franka Control Interface`_ (FCI), which can be accessed through open-source  components available on
`GitHub <https://github.com/frankaemika>`_. These components include the `libfranka`_ C++ library for low-level control and
the `franka_ros`_ high-level ROS interface that supports both ROS Control and MoveIt! The Panda robot also has a simulated 
counterpart known as :franka-ros:`franka_gazebo <tree/develop/franka_gazebo>`. This simulation closely mirrors the SDK
systems of the real robot, ensuring that developments in the simulation translate seamlessly to the real robot.

.. attention::
   It's important to note that there are minor disparities between the real and simulated Panda robot:

   - Masses and inertias differ between the simulated and real robot.
   - Simulation motion generators do not match those in the `FCI`_.

System dependencies
===================

The Panda environment requires the following system dependencies to be installed on the host machine:

- :ROS:`ROS Noetic <noetic>`.
- The `libfranka`_ library.

.. important::

   It is recommended to build the `libfranka`_ library from source in accordance with the `Franka Emika documentation`_. This will ensure that the
   latest version of the library is installed.

Control types
=============

In the :ros-gazebo-gym:`ros_gazebo_gym <>` version of the Panda environment, four control types are supported: ``effort``, ``position``, ``trajectory``, and
``end-effector`` control. The end-effector control is facilitated through `MoveIt`_.

Task environments
=================

The panda :ros-gazebo-gym:`ros_gazebo_gym <>` package comprises task environments adapted from the fetch environments in the :gymnasium:`gymnasium <>` package. Currently, it includes the following task environments:

* :class:`PandaReach-v1 <ros_gazebo_gym.task_envs.panda.panda_reach>`: Move the Panda robot to a goal position.
* :class:`PandaPickAndPlace-v1 <ros_gazebo_gym.task_envs.panda.panda_pick_and_place>`: Lift a block into the air.
* :class:`PandaPush-v1 <ros_gazebo_gym.task_envs.panda.panda_push>`: Push a block to a goal position.
* :class:`PandaSlide-v1 <ros_gazebo_gym.task_envs.panda.panda_slide>`: Slide a puck to a goal position.

.. note::
   The components responsible for creating the :ros-gazebo-gym:`ros_gazebo_gym <>` Panda environment are enclosed within the :panda-gazebo:`panda-gazebo <>` ROS workspace package. This package is automatically downloaded and built by the :ros-gazebo-gym:`ros_gazebo_gym <>` package when running one of the panda task environments.
